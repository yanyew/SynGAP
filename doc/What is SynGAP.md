A toolkit for comparative genomics and transcriptomics research of related species.

**SynGAP** (**Synteny-based Genome Annotations Polisher**) is a Python-based command-line toolkit, which can locate and correct potential omissions and errors in existing genome annotations of related species based on gene synteny analysis. Meanwhile, it provides an effective index _EVI_ (Expression Variation Index), which is suitable for comparative transcriptomics analysis and can help to locate candidate genes that contribute to vital differential traits of related species.

It supports two main workflows:
(1) **genome annotations polishment for related species** (_dual_, _master_, _triple_, and _custom_);
(2) **gene differential expression analysis of related species** (_genepair_, _evi_, and _eviplot_).

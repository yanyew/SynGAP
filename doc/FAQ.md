**Q: How does the evolutionary distance between species affect the performance of SynGAP? And what kind of species should I choose?**
A: An increase in phylogenetic distance does lead to a decrease in SynGAP performance. We recommend using closely related species (within the same family or genus) for polishing to achieve optimal performance.
